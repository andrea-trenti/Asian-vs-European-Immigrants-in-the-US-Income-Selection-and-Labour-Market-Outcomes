# Country Case Studies and Policy Implications: Italy, Germany, UK, India, China, Philippines, Pakistan

## Abstract

This paper presents country-level case studies for selected European (Italy, Germany, United Kingdom) and Asian (India, China, Philippines, Pakistan) sending countries, linking domestic education and labour-market structures to the profiles and outcomes of their emigrants in the United States. Drawing on OECD, World Bank and Migration Policy Institute (MPI) data, it estimates selection ratios, typical visa channels, occupational patterns and approximate income levels for migrants from each country.[1][2][3] It then derives implications for origin-country policy on higher education and migration, and for US policymakers and firms on talent strategies. While precise estimates require microdata, the comparative analysis highlights distinct “emigration models”: India and China as high-skill STEM exporters via H-1B and student routes; the Philippines as a global health labour supplier; Pakistan as an emerging high-skill and mid-skill source; Italy and Germany as moderate-scale senders of skilled workers with strong integration into Europe; and the UK as a high-income sender with lower selection intensity.

## 1. Introduction

The aggregate comparison between Asian and European immigrants masks substantial heterogeneity within each region. From the perspective of both origin and destination countries, it is often more useful to understand individual “country models” of emigration and labour-market integration.

This paper focuses on eight countries:

- **Europe**: Italy, Germany, United Kingdom.  
- **Asia**: India, China, Philippines, Pakistan.

They represent different combinations of population size, income level, education systems and migration patterns.

## 2. Data and stylised facts by country

### 2.1 Italy

- Population: ~59 million.  
- Tertiary attainment (25–64): about **20%**.[1]  
- Emigration to the US: relatively small in absolute terms compared with the early 20th century; modern Italian emigrants are more educated than the domestic average, with tertiary shares estimated above **50%** among Italy-born adults in the US.[4]  
- Fields and occupations: mix of engineering, design, academia, hospitality and business.  
- Visa channels: combination of employment-based (for professionals), L-1 intracompany transfers, and non-negligible family-based flows.

Policy implication: Italy’s challenge is less about massive brain drain to the US and more about the **cumulative outflow of skilled workers across Europe and North America**, given relatively low domestic tertiary attainment.

### 2.2 Germany

- Population: ~84 million.  
- Tertiary attainment: around **33%**.[1]  
- German-born immigrants in the US are typically highly educated (tertiary share ~60–65% in prior ACS-based studies), many working in engineering, research, manufacturing, academia and finance.[4]  
- Germany has a strong domestic labour market and also attracts migrants, so US-bound emigration is selective but modest relative to EU mobility.

Policy implication: Germany’s US-bound emigrants are a small but high-skill subset; domestic policy focuses more on **retention and attraction of talent within Europe** than on US emigration per se.

### 2.3 United Kingdom

- Population: ~67 million.  
- Tertiary attainment: about **51%** of 25–64-year-olds.[1]  
- UK-born immigrants to the US have high education and incomes, but selection ratios are lower than for countries with lower domestic tertiary rates (because the home population is already highly educated).  
- Strong representation in finance, consulting, media, academia and tech.

Policy implication: UK–US flows are more of a **two-way high-skill exchange** than a one-way brain drain; policy concerns focus on post-Brexit talent flows and competition between London and US hubs.

### 2.4 India

- Population: ~1.4 billion.  
- Tertiary attainment: adult rates around **14–20%**, with tertiary enrolment ~30–35%.[1][5][7]  
- Indian-origin population in the US (immigrants and US-born): ~5 million; India-born immigrants: ~2.9 million.[2][6]  
- Around **77–81%** of Indian-origin adults hold at least a bachelor’s degree.[6][0news81]  
- Median household income: **$151,200** for Indian-headed households, highest among major Asian groups.[6][0news81]  
- Dominant visa channels: H-1B, F-1/OPT and employment-based green cards; Indian-born workers represent **>70%** of H-1B beneficiaries.[2][8]

Policy implication: India operates as a **global supplier of high-skill STEM labour**. Domestic policy must balance domestic innovation and public-sector needs against the benefits of remittances, diaspora networks and return migration. For the US, Indian migrants are central to tech and healthcare talent pipelines.

### 2.5 China

- Population: ~1.4 billion.  
- Tertiary attainment: rising, with tertiary enrolment ~60%; adult attainment lower but growing.[1][5]  
- China-born immigrants (including Hong Kong) in the US: ~2.4 million.[2]  
- High rates of tertiary education among immigrants (~55–60% bachelor+), many entering via student visas and transitioning to high-skill work.[2][6]  
- Strong representation in STEM research, academia and tech.

Policy implication: China is simultaneously a **source and destination** of high-skill talent; US–China migration is increasingly entangled with geopolitical and national-security concerns.

### 2.6 Philippines

- Population: ~118 million.  
- Tertiary attainment: around **25–30%**; strong vocational and nursing education systems.[1][5]  
- Filipino-born immigrants in the US: ~2.1 million, with a long history of migration.[2]  
- Occupational profile: heavily concentrated in **nursing, healthcare support, caregiving and public services**.  
- Household incomes above immigrant averages but below Indian and Chinese levels.

Policy implication: The Philippines acts as a **global health labour exporter**, raising concerns about domestic shortages but also generating significant remittances.

### 2.7 Pakistan

- Population: ~240 million.  
- Tertiary attainment: low but rising (enrolment roughly **15–20%**).[7]  
- Pakistani-origin population in the US: smaller than Indian or Chinese groups but growing; tertiary attainment among migrants likely ~50–60%.[7][9]  
- Occupational profile: mix of STEM professionals, medical doctors, small business owners and services.

Policy implication: Pakistan is an **emerging high-skill and mid-skill sender**; policies that improve domestic tertiary systems and connect with diaspora networks can leverage migration for development.

## 3. Framework

We summarise each country’s “emigration model” using four dimensions:

1. **Domestic education base** ($T_c$): tertiary attainment share.  
2. **Selection ratio** ($S_c$): tertiary share among US immigrants vs domestic $T_c$.  
3. **Visa mix** ($V_c$): relative use of high-skill vs non-skill-filtering channels.  
4. **Occupational focus** ($O_c$): distribution across major occupation/sector clusters.

Expected migrant income $Y_c$ can be expressed as:

$$
Y_c = f(T_c, S_c, V_c, O_c)
$$

with $f$ increasing in each argument, given complementary effects.

## 4. Scenarios and analysis

### 4.1 Comparative table (stylised)

| Country | Tertiary at home $T_c$ | Selection ratio $S_c$ | High-skill visa share | Main occupations | Rough US household income rank |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| India | Low–mid (14–20%) | Very high (4+)| Very high (H-1B/EB) | STEM, IT, health | Top |
| China | Mid (25–30% adult) | High (2–3) | High (student→work) | STEM, research | Upper |
| Philippines | Mid (25–30%) | High (2–3) | Medium (health visas) | Nursing, health support | Upper-middle |
| Pakistan | Low (≤20%) | High (2–3) | Medium | STEM, medicine, business | Upper-middle |
| Italy | Low (20%) | Medium–high (2–2.5) | Medium | Eng., design, services | Middle–upper |
| Germany | Mid (33%) | High (≈2) | Medium–high | Eng., manufacturing, research | Upper-middle |
| UK | High (51%) | Moderate (1.3) | Medium–high | Finance, consulting, media, tech | Upper |

Income ranks are relative within immigrant groups, not exact numbers.

### 4.2 Policy levers and trade-offs

For each origin:

- **India**:  
  - Benefits: large remittance flows, global networks, high human capital per emigrant.  
  - Costs: potential domestic shortages in some sectors, risk of over-reliance on external labour markets.  
  - Policy levers: expand domestic high-quality tertiary education, incentivise return or remote collaboration, leverage diaspora in innovation and investment.

- **China**:  
  - Benefits: high-skill diaspora in science and tech.  
  - Costs: brain drain concerns, political tensions around dual loyalties.  
  - Policy levers: improve research environments domestically, manage international academic cooperation, attract returnees.

- **Philippines**:  
  - Benefits: remittances and overseas employment opportunities for health workers.  
  - Costs: local health system strain.  
  - Policy levers: scale training capacity, improve domestic retention, negotiate bilateral agreements on ethical recruitment.

- **Pakistan**:  
  - Benefits: upgrading of human capital via emigrant education and experience.  
  - Costs: potential brain drain of scarce tertiary graduates.  
  - Policy levers: strengthen tertiary education, foster entrepreneurship, and engage diaspora.

- **Italy, Germany, UK**:  
  - Benefits: strong integration in EU labour markets; US-bound migrants contribute to global networks.  
  - Costs: pockets of skilled emigration combined with domestic underinvestment in human capital (especially Italy).  
  - Policy levers: improve domestic conditions for high-skill workers, streamline circular migration, attract foreign talent.

## 5. Risks and caveats

- **Data limitations**: Many country-specific statistics on migrants’ education and income rely on aggregations and older cohorts; exact current distributions require microdata.  
- **Dynamic context**: Political changes (e.g. Brexit, US immigration reforms, geopolitical tensions) affect flows and visa mixes.  
- **Intra-country inequalities**: Domestic regional disparities (northern vs southern Italy, coastal vs inland China, etc.) influence who migrates but are not modelled explicitly.

## 6. Comparison and implications

The case studies illustrate that:

- Asian countries such as India and China send highly selected STEM-oriented migrants whose income levels in the US are primarily a function of their high **$S_c$** and **$V_c$** in high-skill categories.  
- Italy and Germany send fewer migrants, but with selection that is noticeable relative to domestic education levels; however, their global strategy is more European than US-focused.  
- The Philippines and Pakistan demonstrate how health and mixed-skill migration can be part of a broader development strategy if managed well.

For **US policymakers and firms**, these profiles inform talent strategies: where to recruit for specific skillsets, how visa design affects supply, and how to anticipate shocks in given talent pipelines.

For **origin countries**, the key challenge is aligning domestic education and labour-market policies with the realities of global migration, to ensure that emigration complements rather than undermines domestic development.

## 7. Conclusion

Country-level differences in education, visa usage and occupational patterns translate into distinct emigration models and income outcomes in the US. Understanding these models is essential for designing policies that harness the benefits of migration while mitigating its costs. The Asia–Europe aggregate comparison is thus best understood as a composite of multiple country stories, each with its own trade-offs and strategic options.
