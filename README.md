# Asian and European Immigrants in the United States – Income, Selection and Labour-Market Outcomes

This repository is a structured series of Markdown working papers analysing why immigrants from Asia and Europe exhibit different income distributions in the United States, despite operating under the same institutional and macroeconomic environment. The papers combine official statistics, empirical literature and simple quantitative frameworks to disentangle the roles of educational selection, field-of-study, occupational and sectoral sorting, visa channels, geography, within-job pay gaps and intergenerational mobility.

The project is designed as a set of stand-alone research notes. Each file is a self-contained paper with its own data references, simple modelling and scenario analysis. The repository does **not** contain individual-level microdata, code or full datasets; instead, it focuses on synthesising evidence from ACS/CPS aggregates, institutional reports and peer-reviewed work into reusable analytical structures.

## Files in this repository

## How to use this project

- As background input for investor memos, strategy documents and internal notes on global talent pipelines and location strategy.
- As a reference for students and analysts studying migration, labour markets, inequality and human-capital allocation.
- As a template to replicate similar analyses for other origin regions (e.g. Latin America, Africa) or destination countries beyond the United States.
- As structured material for academic or policy seminars on immigration, selection and labour-market outcomes.
- As a starting point for more granular work using microdata (e.g. IPUMS ACS, restricted-use datasets) and econometric models.
