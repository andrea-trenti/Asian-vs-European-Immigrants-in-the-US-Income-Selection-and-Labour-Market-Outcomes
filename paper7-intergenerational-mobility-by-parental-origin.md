# Intergenerational Mobility and Outcomes by Parental Origin: Asian vs European Immigrants in the US

## Abstract

This paper analyses intergenerational outcomes for US-born children of Asian and European immigrants, focusing on education and income. Using Pew Research Center work on second-generation Americans, OECD studies on immigrant-origin students, and related literature, it shows that second-generation individuals with Asian parental origin attain higher levels of education and household income than both their immigrant parents and US averages, while those with European parental origin converge closely to white native benchmarks.[1][2][3] The paper introduces a simple two-period model linking parental human capital and selection to children’s outcomes and uses stylised data to compare mobility patterns. The analysis suggests that the high educational selection and occupational sorting of first-generation Asian immigrants translate into strong intergenerational advantages, while European-origin children experience more standard convergence. Policy implications are discussed for origin and destination countries.

## 1. Introduction

Intergenerational mobility is a critical lens for assessing the long-run impact of immigration. While first-generation income differences between Asian and European immigrants reflect strong selection and labour-market sorting, the key question for societies is how their children fare.

Pew and other researchers have documented that second-generation Americans generally outperform first-generation immigrants in education and income, often approaching or surpassing US averages.[1][2] However, outcomes vary by parental origin: children of Asian immigrants are typically overrepresented in higher education and high-paying occupations, whereas children of European immigrants resemble white natives more closely.

This paper summarises available evidence and embeds it in a simple model of intergenerational transmission of human capital and status.

## 2. Data and stylised facts

### 2.1 Second-generation Americans in aggregate

Pew’s 2013 report on second-generation Americans, based on ACS data, finds that:[1]

- About **20 million** adult US-born children of immigrants exhibit higher incomes, more education and higher homeownership than their parents.  
- Their characteristics generally resemble those of the broader US adult population, with important differences by origin.

### 2.2 Asian-origin second generation

Evidence on Asian-origin children shows:[2][3][4]

- High levels of educational attainment: a large share obtain bachelor’s and advanced degrees, often in STEM and health fields.  
- Household incomes often exceeding those of white natives and similar or higher than those of their own parents, partly due to high-earning jobs and dual-earner households.  
- Lower poverty rates than the average for second-generation individuals from other regions.

The OECD’s work on educational achievement of immigrant-origin students highlights that children of Asian immigrants often have test scores and attainment above native averages once parental education is controlled for.[3][15]

### 2.3 European-origin second generation

For children of European immigrants (e.g. Italian, German, Irish, Polish origin), historical and contemporary evidence suggests:[1][5]

- Strong convergence to the socioeconomic status of white natives over several generations.  
- High rates of intermarriage and assimilation, leading to disappearance of distinct income patterns by the second or third generation.  
- Educational attainment levels that broadly match white native averages, reflecting both the relatively high starting point of European immigrants and similarities in language and cultural capital.

### 2.4 Implications for the Asia–Europe comparison

Thus, while first-generation Asian immigrants have higher incomes than Europeans due largely to selection and sorting, second-generation Asian-origin Americans maintain and sometimes expand this advantage. European-origin second generations converge to white native benchmarks and reflect the broader distribution of white Americans more than specific parental-origin effects.

## 3. Framework

We adopt a simple two-period intergenerational model. Let parental human capital $H_p$ for group $g$ be characterised by:

$$
H_{p,g} = (E_g, O_g, L_g)
$$

where:

- $E_g$ captures education (level and field);  
- $O_g$ captures occupational and sectoral status;  
- $L_g$ captures location and network quality.

Children’s human capital $H_{c,g}$ is determined by:

$$
H_{c,g} = \rho H_{p,g} + (1 - \rho) H^* + \eta_g
$$

where:

- $\rho$ is the persistence parameter (0 < $\rho$ < 1);  
- $H^*$ is the baseline human capital determined by US institutions and overall opportunities;  
- $\eta_g$ captures group-specific shocks or cultural factors (e.g. educational norms).

Income in adulthood is:

$$
Y_{c,g} = f(H_{c,g}) + \epsilon_{c,g}
$$

Assuming $f(\cdot)$ is increasing and concave, groups with higher parental $H_{p,g}$ and higher $\eta_g$ will have higher expected incomes in the second generation.

## 4. Scenarios and analysis

### 4.1 Comparing parental human capital

From previous papers:

- Asian immigrants have higher average $E_g$ (more tertiary and advanced degrees) and more STEM-oriented education; higher $O_g$ (more high-paying occupations); and $L_g$ concentrated in high-opportunity metros.  
- European immigrants have moderately high $E_g$ and $O_g$, but closer to native benchmarks and with more diverse $L_g$.

Stylised values (on a 0–1 scale):

- Asian parents: $H_{p,A} \approx 0.8$  
- European parents: $H_{p,E} \approx 0.6$  
- Native baseline: $H^* \approx 0.5$

Assume $\rho = 0.5$ (moderate intergenerational persistence) and $\eta_A > \eta_E$ reflecting stronger educational emphasis in many Asian-origin communities.[2][3][4]

### 4.2 Children’s human capital

Compute expected children’s human capital:

- Asians:

$$
H_{c,A} = 0.5 \cdot 0.8 + 0.5 \cdot 0.5 + \eta_A = 0.4 + 0.25 + \eta_A = 0.65 + \eta_A
$$

- Europeans:

$$
H_{c,E} = 0.5 \cdot 0.6 + 0.5 \cdot 0.5 + \eta_E = 0.3 + 0.25 + \eta_E = 0.55 + \eta_E
$$

If we posit $\eta_A \approx 0.05$ and $\eta_E \approx 0$, then:

- $H_{c,A} \approx 0.70$  
- $H_{c,E} \approx 0.55$

This reflects higher average education and occupational prospects for Asian-origin children.

### 4.3 Income implications

Assume a simple linear mapping:

$$
E[Y_{c,g}] = \alpha + \beta H_{c,g}
$$

with $\beta > 0$. If we set $\beta = 100,000$ dollars for intuition and $\alpha = 20,000$, we get:

- Asians: $E[Y_{c,A}] = 20,000 + 100,000 \cdot 0.70 = 90,000$  
- Europeans: $E[Y_{c,E}] = 20,000 + 100,000 \cdot 0.55 = 75,000$

These levels are consistent with evidence that second-generation Asian-origin adults often have household incomes above US medians and comparable to or above their parents’, while European-origin second generations cluster around white native medians (~$70,000–80,000$).[1][2]

### 4.4 Mobility and convergence patterns

Under this framework, we observe:

- **Upward mobility** from first- to second-generation immigrants for both groups, as $H_{c,g} > H^*$.  
- **Partial convergence** toward US averages, moderated by $\rho$.  
- **Persistent advantage** for Asians due to higher $H_{p,A}$ and positive $\eta_A$.

In data, this corresponds to:

- High rates of college completion among Asian-origin second generations, often exceeding 50–60%.[2][3][4]  
- Convergence of European-origin second generations to white native education levels (also high) but without a strong overperformance relative to natives.[1][5]

## 5. Risks and caveats

- **Old vs new cohorts**: Much evidence on European-origin children relates to older waves of migration; recent European migrants may have different patterns.  
- **Heterogeneity within regions**: Outcomes differ greatly among Asian subgroups (e.g. Indian vs Hmong vs Vietnamese) and among European subgroups.  
- **Changing US context**: The opportunity structure for second-generation Americans depends on broader trends in inequality, education and labour markets, which evolve over time.  
- **Measurement limitations**: Linking parental-origin to children’s outcomes requires multi-generational data; sample sizes for some origin groups are small.[1][3][15]

## 6. Comparison and implications

For **origin-country policymakers**, high intergenerational success among Asian-origin children in the US implies both costs (loss of high-potential individuals and their descendants) and opportunities (diaspora networks, remittances, possible return migration). European countries experience similar dynamics but with less extreme selection.

For **US policymakers**, the evidence suggests that children of immigrants, particularly from Asia, contribute significantly to the high-skill labour force. Ensuring access to quality education and addressing any residual barriers (e.g. discrimination, school segregation) is critical.

For **firms and investors**, second-generation Asian-origin and European-origin Americans represent deep pools of human capital; understanding their educational and occupational profiles can inform recruitment and talent strategies.

## 7. Conclusion

Intergenerational dynamics reinforce, rather than erase, the differences created by first-generation selection and sorting. US-born children of Asian immigrants often achieve very high levels of education and income, reflecting both parental human capital and community-level emphasis on education. Children of European immigrants converge closely to white native benchmarks, reflecting the relatively modest gap between European migrants and natives in the first place.

These patterns underscore that evaluating immigration solely on the basis of first-generation outcomes misses a crucial part of the story: the long-run contributions and opportunities of subsequent generations.
