# Global Income Differentials of Asian and European Immigrants in the United States

## Abstract

This paper quantifies and explains the income differentials between immigrants from Asia and Europe living in the United States over the period 1990–2025. Using aggregate evidence from the American Community Survey (ACS), Current Population Survey (CPS), Migration Policy Institute (MPI) regional profiles and Pew Research Center, it documents that Asian-born immigrants have substantially higher household incomes and educational attainment than both European immigrants and US-born residents, while Europeans occupy an intermediate position between Asians and other foreign-born groups.[1][2][3] The analysis decomposes income gaps into components associated with education, occupational and sectoral sorting, geography within the US and residual within-job differences. A stylised Oaxaca–Blinder style decomposition, calibrated on recent literature, suggests that 70–80% of the Asia–Europe income gap is explained by observable characteristics, particularly the combination of higher tertiary attainment and stronger concentration of Asian immigrants in high-wage sectors and metro areas, with only a modest unexplained residual likely attributable to discrimination, networks and unobserved skills.[4] Numerical results are order-of-magnitude estimates, as full microdata access is beyond the scope of this note.

## 1. Introduction

The United States hosts almost 48 million foreign-born residents as of 2023, equivalent to roughly 14% of the total population.[2] Among them, immigrants from Asia and Europe together account for around 41% of the foreign-born stock, with Asia representing the second-largest origin region after the Americas and Europe now a smaller but still economically important group.[1][2]

Despite sharing the same destination country, macro environment and federal labour-market institutions, Asian and European immigrants exhibit markedly different income and education profiles. Asia-born adults in the US are far more likely to hold university degrees, work in high-skill occupations and live in high-wage metropolitan areas than both Europeans and the average immigrant.[1][3] As a result, households headed by Asians earn substantially more than those headed by Europeans on average, even after controlling for broad demographic characteristics.[3]

Understanding the mechanisms behind these income differentials is important for several reasons. For firms, particularly in technology, finance and healthcare, cross-country differences in migrant selection shape the supply of high-skill labour and thus influence location decisions and wage-setting. For policymakers in sending countries, the composition of emigrants affects “brain drain” versus “brain gain” dynamics. For US policymakers, the distribution of earnings across origin groups intersects with debates about high-skill immigration, inequality and social mobility.

This paper sets up the baseline quantitative picture that later notes in the series will refine. It focuses on descriptive evidence and a simple decomposition rather than firm-level microeconometrics, but explicitly links aggregate numbers to the mechanisms that will be analysed in more detail in subsequent papers.

## 2. Data and stylised facts

### 2.1 Stock and regional composition

According to MPI and ACS 2023, there were approximately **47.8 million immigrants** residing in the US, up from 31 million in 2000 and about 20 million in 1990.[2] In 2023:

- **Asia-born immigrants**: about **14.6 million** people, or **31%** of all immigrants.[1]  
- **Europe-born immigrants**: about **4.7 million**, or **10%** of all immigrants.[2]  
- The remainder are from the Americas (~52%) and Africa/Oceania.[2]

Within Asia, the largest single origin countries are India (~2.9 million foreign-born), China including Hong Kong (~2.4 million), the Philippines (~2.1 million) and Vietnam.[1] Within Europe, the stock is more fragmented: the largest groups include the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and now Ukraine following the 2022 invasion.[2]

As a share of total US population (~336 million in 2023), Asia-born immigrants represent roughly **4.3–4.5%** while Europe-born represent about **1.4%**.[2][18]

### 2.2 Educational attainment by region of birth

Using ACS 2023 microdata summarised by MPI:

- Among **Asia-born adults (25+)**, **56%** hold at least a bachelor’s degree, compared to **35%** among all immigrants and **36%** among US-born adults.[1]  
- Among **Europe-born adults**, approximately **47%** hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, well above the overall foreign-born average but below the Asian figure.[2]  

Conversely, only about **12–14%** of Asia-born adults lack a high school diploma, compared with **26%** among all immigrants.[1][8] For Europeans the share without high school is in the low double digits, again better than the average immigrant but somewhat worse than US-born adults.[2]

When mapped against educational attainment in origin countries, these numbers imply strong positive selection. For example, OECD’s *Education at a Glance 2025* reports tertiary attainment (ISCED 5+) in the domestic 25–64 population of about **20%** in Italy, **33%** in Germany, **42%** in France and **51–54%** in the UK and Ireland.[5][13][20] In contrast, tertiary enrolment rates in India and other South Asian countries are around **20–35%**, and in many Southeast Asian countries tertiary attainment is still well below OECD averages.[5][20][7] The fact that 56% of Asia-born US immigrants hold tertiary degrees therefore represents an even more extreme selection relative to their home populations than the 47% for Europeans.

### 2.3 Income levels

Pew Research Center reports that in 2023 households headed by an Asian person (regardless of birthplace) had a **median income of $105,600**, compared with **$75,500** for all US households.[3] Within the Asian category, Indian-headed households reached **$151,200** in median income and Taiwanese-headed households **$133,300**.[3] A more detailed Pew study of the Asian American middle class shows that median income for Asian households in the US middle tier rose from about **$97,200** in 2009 to **$112,400** in 2022 (all in 2023 dollars), while the upper-income tier saw median incomes climb from **$220,500** to **$277,600**.[10]

MPI’s synthesis using ACS shows that:

- **Asia-born immigrants** have a **median household income around $105,000–$110,000**, roughly **35–40%** above the overall immigrant median (~$78,700) and above the native-born median (~$77,600).[1][6]  
- **Europe-born immigrants** have a **median household income around $86,000**, sitting between Asian immigrants and both the overall immigrant and native-born medians.[2][6]  

Poverty rates differ accordingly. Around **11%** of Asia-born immigrants live below the federal poverty line, compared to **12–13%** for Europe-born and **14%** for all immigrants.[1][2][18] These figures already suggest that Asian immigrants occupy a substantially more advantaged position in the US income distribution than Europeans or other foreign-born groups.

### 2.4 Occupations and sectors

ACS tabulations show that about **57%** of Asia-born immigrants work in **management, business, science and arts occupations**, compared with **38%** for all foreign-born and **44%** for US-born.[1] Within this category there is a particularly strong presence in computer and mathematical, engineering and healthcare practitioner occupations.

Europe-born immigrants also have a high share in skilled occupations but with a different composition: more concentration in healthcare, education, construction, manufacturing and hospitality, and a lower share in ICT compared with Asians.[2][3]

These patterns align with H-1B visa statistics: in fiscal year 2023, **72%** of approved H-1B petitions were for beneficiaries born in India and **12%** for those born in China.[4][19] No European country comes close to these shares, indicating that high-skill work visas are heavily skewed toward certain Asian countries and fields (especially ICT and engineering).

### 2.5 Geography inside the US

Asia-born immigrants are disproportionately located in high-wage states and metropolitan areas. MPI estimates show that more than half of Asian immigrants live in **California, New York, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois**, with very high concentrations in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC metros.[1]

By contrast, Europe-born immigrants are more geographically dispersed, with significant numbers in **New York–New Jersey**, **Florida**, **California** and several Midwestern and Northeastern states where average wages are lower than in the tech hubs.[2][18] This spatial allocation further amplifies nominal income differences between Asian and European immigrants.

## 3. Framework

To structure the discussion of income differentials, consider a simplified decomposition of average labour income per worker for a group $g$:

$$
\bar{y}_g = \sum_{j \in J} \pi_{g,j} \, \bar{w}_{g,j}
$$

where:

- $J$ indexes job “cells” defined by occupation, sector, firm size and metro area;
- $\pi_{g,j}$ is the share of group $g$ employed in job cell $j$;
- $\bar{w}_{g,j}$ is the average wage of group $g$ in job cell $j$.

The income gap between Asian and European immigrants can be decomposed into:

$$
\bar{y}_A - \bar{y}_E = \sum_j (\pi_{A,j} - \pi_{E,j}) \bar{w}_{E,j} \;+\; \sum_j \pi_{A,j} (\bar{w}_{A,j} - \bar{w}_{E,j})
$$

The first term captures **sorting effects** (different job allocation at European wages), and the second term captures **within-job wage gaps** (different pay for Asians vs Europeans in the same job cell).

Empirical work using linked employer–employee data in advanced economies finds that **between 69% and 83%** of immigrant–native wage gaps are explained by differential sorting across jobs and firms, with the remainder attributable to within-job differences.[4][14][21] While these studies typically distinguish regions of origin (e.g. Asia vs Europe vs Latin America), they are consistent with the idea that most of the Asia–Europe income gap among US immigrants arises from sorting rather than systematic within-job pay differences.

To relate sorting to observable characteristics, write the expected wage for group $g$ as:

$$
\bar{y}_g = f(E_g, X_g, L_g)
$$

where:

- $E_g$ denotes the distribution of education and field-of-study;
- $X_g$ encapsulates occupational, sectoral and firm sorting;
- $L_g$ represents location (metro, state) and hours worked.

A reduced-form linear approximation is:

$$
\bar{y}_g \approx \beta_0 + \beta_E E_g + \beta_X X_g + \beta_L L_g + \epsilon_g
$$

with $\epsilon_g$ capturing residual within-job gaps, unobserved skills and discrimination. The objective of the broader series is to unpack each block in detail; this first paper focuses on the relative contribution of $E_g$, $X_g$ and $L_g$ using stylised empirical evidence.

## 4. Scenarios and analysis

### 4.1 Baseline decomposition

We construct a simple three-factor decomposition of the Asian–European immigrant household income gap:

- Education factor ($E$): difference in tertiary attainment and field-of-study.  
- Sorting factor ($S$): difference in occupation and sector conditional on education.  
- Location factor ($L$): difference in geography and cost-of-living-adjusted wages.  

Let $\Delta y = \bar{y}_A - \bar{y}_E$ denote the observed income gap between Asia-born and Europe-born immigrant households (roughly $105,000 - 86,000 = 19,000$ dollars).[1][2][6]

Assume:

- Education accounts for a share $\theta_E$ of the explained gap;  
- Sorting conditional on education accounts for $\theta_S$;  
- Location accounts for $\theta_L$;  
- A residual $\theta_R$ remains unexplained, with $\theta_E + \theta_S + \theta_L + \theta_R = 1$.

Drawing on Hermansen et al. (2025) and related decomposition studies, we calibrate:

- overall explained share (education + sorting + location) $\approx 0.75$ of $\Delta y$;  
- within-job residual $\approx 0.25$.[4][14][21]

Within the explained component, ACS and MPI evidence suggests that about two-thirds of Asian immigrants’ advantage over Europeans stems from **education and occupation**, and one-third from **location**.[1][2]

A plausible allocation is:

- $\theta_E \approx 0.25$  
- $\theta_S \approx 0.25$  
- $\theta_L \approx 0.25$  
- $\theta_R \approx 0.25$

Under this calibration:

- Education contributes roughly $0.25 \times 19,000 \approx 4,750$ dollars.  
- Sorting contributes another ~$4,750$.  
- Location adds ~$4,750$.  
- Residual factors (within-job gaps, unobserved skill, discrimination, hours) contribute the remaining ~$4,750$.

These numbers are not precise estimates but illustrate that **no single channel fully explains the gap**. However, they also show that **three quarters of the difference is attributable to observable features** that will be analysed in depth in further papers: education selection (Paper 2), occupational/sectoral sorting (Paper 3) and visa-mediated job allocation (Paper 4).

### 4.2 Counterfactual scenarios

We now consider three stylised counterfactuals, using the previous calibration.

#### Scenario 1 – Equal education, unchanged sorting and location

Suppose Europe-born immigrants had the same tertiary attainment distribution as Asia-born immigrants (56% bachelor+ vs current ~47%), while their occupation and location patterns remained unchanged.[1][2]

If education explains roughly one quarter of the income gap, equalising $E$ alone would reduce $\Delta y$ by $4,750$, bringing the European median from $86,000$ to about $90,750$ in this stylised scenario.

The Asian–European gap would fall from $19,000$ to roughly $14,250$, still substantial. This illustrates that **education alone does not close the gap**.

#### Scenario 2 – Equal occupation and sector mix, unchanged education and location

Now assume Europeans keep their current education profile but obtain the same occupational and sectoral mix as Asians (higher share in high-wage STEM and professional occupations, lower share in hospitality and manufacturing).[1][2]

If sorting explains another quarter of the gap, equalising $X_g$ would again raise European incomes by about $4,750$, to roughly **$90,750$**, while Asians remain at $105,000$. The gap again shrinks to $\approx 14,250$.

This scenario emphasises that **even with higher-wage jobs, Europeans would still lag Asians if education composition and geographic allocation continue to differ**.

#### Scenario 3 – Equal education, job sorting and geography, residual only

Finally, equalise education, occupation/sector and location across groups. Under the calibration above, only the residual $\theta_R = 0.25$ remains. The gap falls to about **$4,750$**.

This residual is the part most plausibly attributable to **unobserved productivity, timing of migration, networks, and discrimination**. Importantly, recent studies often find that when analyses are done at the level of “same job, same firm, same location”, within-job gaps are not systematically in favour of Asian immigrants and can even be slightly negative relative to white natives.[4][14] There is no strong evidence of a residual premium paid to Asians relative to equivalently placed Europeans.

The central message is therefore that **the bulk of the Asian–European income difference is structural and compositional**, not a mysterious per-person premium.

## 5. Risks and caveats

Several caveats qualify the analysis:

- **Data aggregation**: Much of the evidence is at the level of broad regions of origin (Asia vs Europe) or ancestry (Asian vs white), not country of birth. Detailed decomposition by individual sending country (Italy, Germany, India, Pakistan, etc.) would require direct ACS microdata access and careful pooling of multiple years.[1][2][3]
- **Household vs individual income**: Many statistics refer to **household income**, which depends on the number of earners and household structure. Asian households often have more earners per household, which raises income independently of individual wages.[1][10]
- **Cost of living**: Higher nominal incomes in coastal metros may partly reflect higher rents and living costs; real-income comparisons require price adjustment by metro or state, which is beyond the detail of this paper but tackled in Paper 5.[10][18]
- **Time dimension**: Cohort effects matter: Europe-born immigrants include older waves with lower education, while many Asia-born immigrants arrived more recently through highly selective channels. Time since migration and age composition both affect incomes.[1][2]
- **Endogeneity**: Education, occupation, location and visa channel are jointly determined by individual choices, home-country institutions and US immigration policy. Treating them as exogenous drivers is a simplification.

These caveats do not overturn the stylised facts presented here but imply that the numerical decomposition should be read as an order-of-magnitude breakdown rather than an exact estimate.

## 6. Comparison and implications

From a comparative standpoint, the Asia–Europe contrast among immigrants in the US resembles differences seen between:

- **High- vs low-selectivity migration systems**: Asian immigrants arriving via H-1B, F-1/OPT and other employment-based channels look similar to “points-based” migrants in Canada or Australia, with high human-capital concentration and strong labour-market outcomes.[4][16]
- **STEM-intensive vs generalist human-capital bundles**: The Asian wage premium is closely tied to a combination of **STEM education, English proficiency and location in high-wage hubs**. European migrants often have high educational attainment but in more heterogeneous disciplines and sectors, leading to more middling wage trajectories.[1][3][5]
- **Gateway vs secondary cities**: Asian immigrants’ tilt toward a handful of gateway metros parallels the concentration of tech and finance workers more generally, reinforcing both opportunities and exposure to high living costs.[1][18]

For **founders and operators**, the evidence implies that:

- Asian immigrant talent pools in the US are disproportionately concentrated in high-productivity, high-wage technical roles, particularly in technology and healthcare.  
- European immigrants may offer more diversified skillsets, valuable in manufacturing, services and traditional industries, but with less extreme wage distributions.

For **investors**, one implication is that sectors and firms intensely reliant on high-skill Asian immigration (e.g. cloud, AI, specialised healthcare) are structurally exposed to policy shifts in visa regimes and international student flows.

For **policymakers** in sending countries, the results highlight different challenges:

- For some Asian countries, especially India, the issue is concentrated loss of high-skill workers but with potential feedback via remittances, networks and return migration.  
- For European countries, emigration to the US is smaller in scale but relatively more balanced in skill composition; the policy focus may be less on “brain drain” and more on encouraging circular migration and leveraging diaspora networks.

US policymakers face trade-offs between preserving high-skill inflows that support innovation and mitigating inequalities that may arise within and across origin groups.

## 7. Conclusion

Asian immigrants in the United States earn substantially more than European immigrants on average, reflecting a combination of **stronger educational selection, more STEM-oriented human capital, greater use of high-skill visa channels and heavier concentration in high-wage metropolitan areas**. European immigrants still outperform the average immigrant and often match or exceed outcomes of native-born workers with similar education, but they do not match the extreme upper-tail concentration of some Asian groups.

A simple decomposition indicates that about three quarters of the Asia–Europe income gap can be attributed to observable differences in education, occupational/sectoral sorting and geography, with only a modest residual likely due to unobserved characteristics and within-job pay gaps. Future papers in this series will analyse each component in more detail, moving from descriptive facts to more explicit modelling of selection mechanisms, visa policies, and intergenerational dynamics.

The key levers shaping outcomes are not ethnicity as such, but **who migrates, through which channels, into which jobs and cities**, and how these elements interact with domestic institutions both in sending and receiving countries.
