# Educational Selection and Field-of-Study Sorting: Asia vs Europe in the US Labour Market

## Abstract

This paper quantifies the intensity and structure of educational selection among immigrants from major Asian and European sending countries to the United States and analyses how field-of-study sorting amplifies income differences. Using OECD *Education at a Glance* data for home-country attainment, ACS-based estimates of immigrant education, and Pew and Migration Policy Institute (MPI) syntheses, it computes selection ratios for tertiary education (share of tertiary-educated among migrants divided by the share in the origin population) and documents that migrants from India, China, Taiwan and other Asian economies exhibit selection ratios of roughly 2–4, compared with 1.5–2.5 for most European senders.[1][2][3] It then shows that Asian migrants are disproportionately concentrated in STEM, health and other high-wage fields, whereas Europeans have a more diversified mix including social sciences, humanities and business.[3][4] A simple model links these differences to expected wage premia by field and clarifies why educational selection and field-of-study composition jointly account for a large share of the observed Asia–Europe income gap. Numerical results are approximate but grounded in order-of-magnitude evidence from official sources.

## 1. Introduction

Educational attainment is a central channel through which migration affects both sending and receiving countries. For receiving countries, high-skilled immigration contributes to innovation, productivity and fiscal sustainability. For sending countries, it raises concerns about “brain drain” but can also support technology transfer and remittances. The composition of emigrants by level and field of education matters as much as the overall rate.

In the US context, immigrants from Asia and Europe both appear highly educated relative to the domestic population, but not to the same extent and not in the same disciplines. Asia-born immigrants have higher rates of tertiary attainment and a sharper concentration in STEM and health fields than Europe-born immigrants.[2][3] Moreover, the educational selection of Asian migrants is often far more extreme relative to the educational distribution in their origin countries.

This paper addresses three questions:

1. How strong is educational selection for major Asian and European sending countries (e.g. India, China, Pakistan, Vietnam vs Italy, Germany, UK, Poland, Romania)?  
2. How different is field-of-study sorting across broad areas (STEM, business, social sciences, humanities, health, law)?  
3. To what extent can differences in $E_g$ (level) and $F_g$ (field mix) account for observed income differentials, holding occupation and geography constant?

## 2. Data and stylised facts

### 2.1 Educational attainment at origin

OECD *Education at a Glance 2025* and complementary UNESCO/World Bank data provide tertiary attainment rates (ISCED 5+) among 25–64-year-olds in origin countries:[1][5][7]

- Selected European OECD countries:  
  - Italy: ~**20%** tertiary attainment.  
  - Germany: ~**33%**.  
  - France: ~**42%**.  
  - Spain: ~**41%**.  
  - Portugal: ~**31%**.  
  - Poland: ~**34%**.  
  - Greece: ~**35%**.  
  - Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Nordics: generally **45–55%**.  

- Selected Asian countries and partners:  
  - Japan: ~**56%** tertiary attainment.  
  - Korea: ~**53%**.  
  - China: tertiary attainment rising rapidly, but still in the **20–30%** range for the adult population (with enrolment higher for younger cohorts).[1][5]  
  - India: tertiary enrolment ratio around **30–35%**, with adult attainment considerably lower (≈14–20% depending on age cohort).[7]  
  - Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Vietnam: tertiary attainment generally **<25%**.[7]

Thus, in many Asian sending countries (especially India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Vietnam), tertiary-educated individuals represent a relatively small elite at home, whereas in Western and Northern Europe tertiary attainment is already widespread.

### 2.2 Educational attainment among immigrants in the US

MPI’s Asia and Europe profiles, based on ACS 2023, show:[2][3]

- Among **Asia-born immigrants (25+)**, **56%** hold at least a bachelor’s degree.  
- Among **Europe-born immigrants**, approximately **47%** hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.  
- Among all foreign-born, **35%** hold a bachelor’s degree or more; among US-born, **36%**.

Although migrant-level estimates by individual origin country require microdata, supplementary analyses and country-specific reports provide order-of-magnitude figures:

- **Indian immigrants**: about **77–81%** of adults (25+) have at least a bachelor’s degree, according to Pew Research and MPI; roughly half hold a master’s, professional degree or PhD.[3][8][19]  
- **Chinese immigrants** (incl. Hong Kong): estimated **55–60%** bachelor+.[2][3]  
- **Filipino immigrants**: around **50–55%** bachelor+; strong presence in nursing and health professions.[2]  
- **Vietnamese immigrants**: lower, but rising; tertiary attainment around **30–35%**.[2]

For European migrants, older work based on Census/ACS 1990–2000 suggests tertiary shares in the **50–60%** range for immigrants from Italy, Germany, France and the UK, but with substantial heterogeneity by cohort.[9]

### 2.3 Selection ratios

Define the **selection ratio** for tertiary education as:

$$
S_c = \frac{\text{share of tertiary-educated among US immigrants from country } c}{\text{share of tertiary-educated in country } c}
$$

For illustrative cases:

- **India**  
  - Tertiary attainment in India: assume **18%** among 25–64-year-olds (midpoint of 14–22%).[7]  
  - Tertiary attainment among India-born US immigrants: ~**80%**.[3][8][19]  
  - Selection ratio: $S_{\text{India}} \approx 80 / 18 \approx 4.4$.

- **China**  
  - Tertiary attainment in adult population: assume **25%**.[1][5]  
  - Tertiary attainment among China-born US immigrants: ~**60%**.  
  - $S_{\text{China}} \approx 60 / 25 \approx 2.4$.

- **Vietnam**  
  - Domestic tertiary attainment: ~**15–20%**.  
  - Among US immigrants: ~**35%**.  
  - $S_{\text{Vietnam}} \approx 35 / 18 \approx 1.9$.

- **Italy**  
  - Domestic tertiary attainment: **20%**.[5]  
  - Among US immigrants: assume **50%** (based on older ACS analyses).[9]  
  - $S_{\text{Italy}} \approx 50 / 20 = 2.5$.

- **Germany**  
  - Domestic tertiary attainment: **33%**.[5]  
  - Among US immigrants: ~**60–65%**.[9]  
  - $S_{\text{Germany}} \approx 62 / 33 \approx 1.9$.

- **UK**  
  - Domestic tertiary attainment: **51%**.  
  - Among US immigrants: ~**65%**.  
  - $S_{\text{UK}} \approx 65 / 51 \approx 1.3$.

These rough calculations highlight two points:

1. **All** major sending countries show positive selection (ratios >1).  
2. Asian senders like India exhibit **extreme selection** ($S_c > 4$), whereas most European senders have ratios between **1.3 and 2.5**.

### 2.4 Field-of-study sorting

Pew and various academic studies document sharp differences in fieldmix between Asian and European migrants:[3][4]

- Among Asian-origin adults (including US-born), around **47–50%** of tertiary degrees are in **science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)** and **health professions**; business and social sciences account for most of the remainder.[3][23]  
- Indian and Chinese immigrants in particular are heavily concentrated in computer science, engineering and quantitative fields, reflecting both domestic education systems and US visa filters.[8][19]  
- European immigrants have a more balanced field mix:  
  - substantial shares in **engineering and natural sciences** (especially from Germany, France, UK, Nordics);  
  - large shares in **business, economics, law and social sciences**;  
  - non-trivial fractions in **humanities and arts**, especially among older cohorts and cultural sectors.[9][15]

This field-of-study sorting matters because US wage premia differ significantly by field. ACS and CPS data show that median earnings for workers with bachelor’s degrees in engineering, computer science or certain health specialties can be **30–70% higher** than for those with degrees in humanities or general social sciences, holding broad experience constant.[3][11]

## 3. Framework

We formalise the impact of educational selection and field-mix on expected wages for group $g$ as:

$$
\bar{w}_g = \sum_{k} \gamma_{g,k} \, \mu_k
$$

where:

- $k$ indexes broad fields of study (e.g. STEM, business, social sciences, humanities, health, law);  
- $\gamma_{g,k}$ is the share of tertiary-educated workers in group $g$ with field $k$;  
- $\mu_k$ is the expected wage premium for field $k$ relative to a baseline (e.g. high school or non-tertiary).

Let $\tau_g$ denote the share of tertiary-educated among all workers in group $g$. Then average wages can be written as:

$$
\bar{y}_g = (1 - \tau_g) \mu_0 + \tau_g \sum_k \gamma_{g,k} \mu_k
$$

with $\mu_0$ the expected wage for non-tertiary workers.

The income gap between Asian and European immigrants can be decomposed into:

$$
\bar{y}_A - \bar{y}_E = (\tau_A - \tau_E)\bigg(\sum_k \gamma_{A,k} \mu_k - \mu_0\bigg)
+ \tau_E \sum_k (\gamma_{A,k} - \gamma_{E,k}) \mu_k
+ \text{residual}
$$

The first term captures differences in **overall tertiary attainment** (level effect). The second captures differences in **field-mix conditional on tertiary** (composition effect). The residual subsumes differences in occupation, sector, geography and unobserved factors.

Our objective in this paper is not to produce a precise decomposition but to illustrate how plausible values of $\tau_g$ and $\gamma_{g,k}$, combined with conservative wage premia $\mu_k$, can explain a large share of the Asia–Europe income gap documented in Paper 1.

## 4. Scenarios and analysis

### 4.1 Calibration of wage premia by field

Using ACS/CPS earnings tables by major field of bachelor’s degree, typical US wage premia (median annual earnings for full-time workers 25–64) versus high school only can be approximated as:[11]

- $\mu_{\text{STEM}} \approx 1.7 \mu_0$ (70% higher than high school).  
- $\mu_{\text{Health}} \approx 1.8 \mu_0$ (including nursing, pharmacy).  
- $\mu_{\text{Business}} \approx 1.3 \mu_0$.  
- $\mu_{\text{SocialSci}} \approx 1.2 \mu_0$.  
- $\mu_{\text{Humanities}} \approx 1.1 \mu_0$.  
- For simplicity, we treat law as a graduate field and fold it into business/social sciences.

Let us assume median wage for non-tertiary is $\mu_0 = \$45,000$; then:

- STEM: $\mu_{\text{STEM}} \approx \$76,500$.  
- Health: $\approx \$81,000$.  
- Business: $\approx \$58,500$.  
- Social sciences: $\approx \$54,000$.  
- Humanities: $\approx \$49,500$.

### 4.2 Field-mix assumptions

Assume the following field distributions among tertiary-educated immigrants (stylised but consistent with Pew and MPI patterns):[2][3][8]

- Asian immigrants (tertiary):  
  - STEM: $\gamma_{A,\text{STEM}} = 0.40$  
  - Health: $\gamma_{A,\text{Health}} = 0.10$  
  - Business: $\gamma_{A,\text{Business}} = 0.25$  
  - Social sciences: $\gamma_{A,\text{SocialSci}} = 0.15$  
  - Humanities: $\gamma_{A,\text{Hum}} = 0.10$

- European immigrants (tertiary):  
  - STEM: $\gamma_{E,\text{STEM}} = 0.25$  
  - Health: $\gamma_{E,\text{Health}} = 0.10$  
  - Business: $\gamma_{E,\text{Business}} = 0.30$  
  - Social sciences: $\gamma_{E,\text{SocialSci}} = 0.20$  
  - Humanities: $\gamma_{E,\text{Hum}} = 0.15$

These values reflect higher STEM share among Asians and more humanities/social sciences among Europeans.

Using $\tau_A = 0.56$ and $\tau_E = 0.47$ as in Section 2.2:[2][3]

### 4.3 Implied expected wages

Compute expected wage for Asian immigrants:

- Average tertiary wage for Asians:

$$
\mu_T^A = 0.40 \cdot 76{,}500 + 0.10 \cdot 81{,}000 + 0.25 \cdot 58{,}500 + 0.15 \cdot 54{,}000 + 0.10 \cdot 49{,}500
$$

Step-by-step:

- $0.40 \cdot 76{,}500 = 30{,}600$  
- $0.10 \cdot 81{,}000 = 8{,}100$  
- $0.25 \cdot 58{,}500 = 14{,}625$  
- $0.15 \cdot 54{,}000 = 8{,}100$  
- $0.10 \cdot 49{,}500 = 4{,}950$

Sum: $30{,}600 + 8{,}100 + 14{,}625 + 8{,}100 + 4{,}950 = 66{,}375$.

Thus $\mu_T^A \approx \$66,400$.

Expected wage:

$$
\bar{y}_A = (1 - 0.56) \cdot 45{,}000 + 0.56 \cdot 66{,}375
$$

- Non-tertiary part: $0.44 \cdot 45{,}000 = 19{,}800$  
- Tertiary part: $0.56 \cdot 66{,}375 \approx 37{,}171$  

Total: $\bar{y}_A \approx 56{,}971$ dollars.

Now for European immigrants:

- Average tertiary wage:

$$
\mu_T^E = 0.25 \cdot 76{,}500 + 0.10 \cdot 81{,}000 + 0.30 \cdot 58{,}500 + 0.20 \cdot 54{,}000 + 0.15 \cdot 49{,}500
$$

Computations:

- $0.25 \cdot 76{,}500 = 19{,}125$  
- $0.10 \cdot 81{,}000 = 8{,}100$  
- $0.30 \cdot 58{,}500 = 17{,}550$  
- $0.20 \cdot 54{,}000 = 10{,}800$  
- $0.15 \cdot 49{,}500 = 7{,}425$

Sum: $19{,}125 + 8{,}100 + 17{,}550 + 10{,}800 + 7{,}425 = 63{,}000$.

Thus $\mu_T^E \approx \$63,000$.

Expected wage:

$$
\bar{y}_E = (1 - 0.47) \cdot 45{,}000 + 0.47 \cdot 63{,}000
$$

- Non-tertiary part: $0.53 \cdot 45{,}000 = 23{,}850$  
- Tertiary part: $0.47 \cdot 63{,}000 = 29{,}610$  

Total: $\bar{y}_E \approx 53{,}460$ dollars.

The difference:

$$
\bar{y}_A - \bar{y}_E \approx 56{,}971 - 53{,}460 \approx 3{,}511 \text{ dollars}
$$

In this stylised calculation, **educational attainment and field mix alone** yield an individual wage premium for Asians over Europeans of about **6.6%** ($3.5k/$53.5k). This is smaller than the observed household income gap (~22%) but substantial given that we have not yet accounted for occupation, sector and metro wages.[2][3]

The difference is driven by:

- higher tertiary share ($\tau_A > \tau_E$);  
- higher STEM share among tertiary-educated Asians ($\gamma_{A,\text{STEM}} > \gamma_{E,\text{STEM}}$);  
- lower share of lower-premium humanities and social sciences.

### 4.4 Counterfactuals

#### Scenario A – Equal tertiary attainment, same field mix

Set $\tau_A = \tau_E = 0.47$ but keep field mixes different.

Recompute:

- Asians:

$$
\bar{y}'_A = (1 - 0.47) \cdot 45{,}000 + 0.47 \cdot 66{,}375
$$

- Non-tertiary: $0.53 \cdot 45{,}000 = 23{,}850$  
- Tertiary: $0.47 \cdot 66{,}375 \approx 31{,}196$  

Total: $\bar{y}'_A \approx 55{,}046$.

Europeans remain at $\bar{y}_E \approx 53{,}460$, so the gap shrinks to **$1,586$**, about **3%**.

Interpretation: **field-of-study differences alone** generate a small but non-negligible wage premium; most of the effect comes from the combination of level and field.

#### Scenario B – Equal field mix, different tertiary attainment

Set $\gamma_{A,k} = \gamma_{E,k}$ but keep $\tau_A = 0.56$, $\tau_E = 0.47$. Using the European field mix as common:

- New tertiary wage for both: $\mu_T = 63,000$.

Then:

- Asians: $\bar{y}''_A = 0.44 \cdot 45,000 + 0.56 \cdot 63,000 = 19,800 + 35,280 = 55,080$.  
- Europeans: unchanged at 53,460.

The gap is **$1,620$**, again about **3%**, now driven purely by tertiary coverage.

#### Scenario C – Combined level + field (baseline)

Combining both differences reproduces the earlier ~6–7% wage premium. Comparing to household income differentials (~22% in Paper 1), we can infer that **roughly one-third of the Asia–Europe household income gap is plausibly attributable to level and field-of-study effects**, with the remainder due to differential occupational/sectoral and geographic sorting and to household composition.

## 5. Risks and caveats

- **Approximate country-level data**: Tertiary attainment rates for immigrants by exact country of birth and field are not fully available in published tables. The calculations rely on a combination of MPI, Pew and older ACS analyses and should be interpreted as indicative, not exact.[2][3][8][9]
- **Static field categories**: Broad field categories (STEM vs non-STEM) mask significant heterogeneity in earnings within fields (e.g. different types of engineering, different business specialisations).  
- **Returns to foreign vs US education**: Earnings premia for degrees obtained abroad can differ from those for US degrees, and this may vary systematically by origin country; this nuance is not captured explicitly here.[4][12]
- **Selection on unobservables**: Migrants may differ from non-migrants not only in observed education but also in ability, motivation and networks, which would alter returns to the same degree; our framework treats these as residual factors.

## 6. Comparison and implications

Comparatively, educational selection and field-of-study sorting among Asian migrants resemble those observed in **points-based migration systems** in Canada and Australia, where skilled visas target STEM and professional occupations.[4][16] By contrast, European migration to the US includes a larger share of family-based and diversity-lottery migrants, yielding a less concentrated human-capital profile.

For **founders and employers**, the implication is that **Asian immigrant talent pools are particularly rich in STEM and health skills**, which are directly complementary to technology and healthcare business models. European immigrants contribute valuable skills in engineering and business but offer more diversity across fields, which may be beneficial in managerial, legal and cultural roles but yields lower aggregate wage premia.

For **sending-country policymakers**, high selection ratios imply substantial human-capital outflows. For India, a selection ratio above four indicates that emigrants to the US are drawn heavily from the upper tail of the educational distribution, with implications for domestic innovation capacity.[7][8] European countries face less extreme selection but may still see non-trivial outflows of high-skill professionals in specific niches (e.g. German engineers, UK finance professionals).

For **US policymakers**, the results underscore that adjusting visa criteria and student pathways effectively reshapes the educational distribution and field mix of immigrants, which in turn affects wage distributions, innovation potential and inequality.

## 7. Conclusion

Educational selection and field-of-study sorting play a central, quantifiable role in explaining why Asian immigrants in the US have higher incomes than their European counterparts. Tertiary attainment levels among Asian migrants are substantially above both the US average and the average in their origin countries, with particularly extreme selection for India and some other Asian senders. Furthermore, Asian migrants are more concentrated in high-premium STEM and health fields, while Europeans exhibit a more balanced mix that includes a larger share of lower-premium humanities and social sciences.

A simple quantitative framework suggests that these differences plausibly account for roughly one-third of the observed Asia–Europe income gap at the household level, with the remainder driven by occupational, sectoral and geographic sorting and household structure. This highlights education and field mix as key levers for both origin and destination countries seeking to influence the composition and labour-market impact of migration.
